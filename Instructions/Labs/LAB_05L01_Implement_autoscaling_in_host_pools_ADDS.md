## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Configure autoscaling of Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Prepare for autoscaling of Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts
1. Create and configure an Azure Automation account
1. Create an Azure Logic app

#### Task 1: Prepare for autoscaling of Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. On the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to start the Azure Virtual Desktop session host Azure VMs you will be using in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG' | Start-AzVM -NoWait
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually started. 

#### Task 2: Create and configure an Azure Automation account

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.

   ```

### Exercise 3: Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

>**Note**: In this exercise, you will deallocate the Azure VMs provisioned in this lab to minimize the corresponding compute charges

#### Task 1: Deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

1. Switch to the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list all Azure VMs created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG'
   ```

1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to stop and deallocate all Azure VMs you created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG' | Stop-AzVM -NoWait -Force
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually stopped and deallocated.
